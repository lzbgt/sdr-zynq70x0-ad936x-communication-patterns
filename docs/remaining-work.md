# Remaining Work

This page tracks concrete work still open after the verified WSL Arch Yocto,
Vivado, SD boot, QSPI `mtd3`, and OpenOCD JTAG bring-up. Recently closed gates
are kept briefly when they affect the remaining recovery decisions.

## Closed Gate: Normal Boot Restore After JTAG

Status: verified for normal SD boot.

After JTAG/OpenOCD PL programming, the board was returned to normal boot mode
with the SD card still inserted. On this hardware, inserted SD media takes
precedence over QSPI unless the boot control is set to JTAG. Verification passed:

```sh
./tools/verify_board.sh
```

Result: ping, IIO, and HTTP checks passed at `192.168.2.1`.

Optional follow-up: remove the SD card and repeat the same check if a fresh
post-JTAG QSPI-only restore proof is needed.

## Closed Gate: Vivado Hardware Manager On Onboard FT2232H

Status: verified.

The onboard FT2232H now works with Vivado Hardware Manager under WSL Arch after:

- raw FT2232 EEPROM backup,
- Vivado `program_ftdi -write -ftdi FT2232H ...`,
- physical DEBUG/JTAG USB replug and `usbipd` reattach,
- setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/Xilinx/2025.1/Vivado/lib/lnx64.o`.

Verified helpers:

```sh
./tools/probe_vivado_hw_manager.sh
./tools/load_vivado_bitstream.sh
```

## Closed Gate: PS-Side JTAG U-Boot Flow

Status: verified for U-Boot loaded from DDR over OpenOCD JTAG.

Verified so far:

- OpenOCD scans the Zynq PL and CPU TAPs.
- OpenOCD loads `system_top.bit` into PL.
- Vivado Hardware Manager detects `arm_dap_0` and `xc7z020_1`.
- Vivado Hardware Manager loads `system_top.bit` into PL.
- The rebuilt artifacts needed for PS-side work exist locally:
  `.config/boot-artifacts/boot/fsbl.elf`,
  `.config/boot-artifacts/boot/u-boot.elf`, and
  `.config/boot-artifacts/sdt/ps7_init.tcl`.
- `tools/run_openocd_jtag_uboot.sh` initializes PS/DDR by translating the
  generated Xilinx `ps7_init.tcl` flow to OpenOCD memory writes, then loads and
  runs the rebuilt `u-boot.elf` from DDR.
- The PS-side JTAG helpers run `tools/reset_openocd_zynq_ps.sh` by default.
  This issues a volatile SLCR PS reset through DAP memory writes and clears the
  sticky ARM debug state that previously required a manual JTAG-mode power
  cycle.
- USB console capture from the JTAG-loaded U-Boot path showed U-Boot starting,
  detecting 1 GiB DDR, detecting QSPI flash, and entering the Pluto U-Boot boot
  flow.
- `examples/jtag-hello/` builds and runs a custom standalone ARM ELF over the
  same OpenOCD PS7-init path. UART capture shows the program running from DDR at
  `0x04000000` without Linux or QSPI writes.

Attempted and not accepted as a working path:

- Directly loading `fsbl.elf` with OpenOCD, setting `pc=0x0`, and resuming the
  Cortex-A9 does not produce a usable PS boot flow yet. The run leaves OpenOCD
  reporting ARM DAP sticky/APB access errors until the board is power-cycled in
  JTAG mode.
- Vivado Hardware Manager still scans the JTAG chain after this failure, so the
  cable path remains good. The problem is PS initialization / reset sequencing,
  not USB pass-through or FT2232 recognition.
- Plain `xsdb targets` is currently empty against the same `hw_server` session,
  even though Vivado Hardware Manager sees `arm_dap_0` and `xc7z020_1`.

Not yet verified:

- Booting Linux from RAM through JTAG.

Remaining candidate implementation:

1. Prefer a Xilinx PS-debug flow if `xsdb` target enumeration can be repaired.
   The vendor script shape is `connect`, `target`, `source ps7_init.tcl`,
   `ps7_init`, `ps7_post_config`, `dow u-boot.elf`, `con`.
2. Compare the OpenOCD PS7-init path against the complete FSBL side effects.
   The current OpenOCD Linux path reaches kernel boot and, with
   `initcall_debug`, stops after `calling axi_dmac_driver_init`. A direct
   OpenOCD DAP read of `0x7c400000`, the RX AXI-DMAC version register, also
   fails after PS7 init and PL programming. The next useful work is therefore
   PS-to-PL AXI/fabric accessibility, not U-Boot command timing or rootfs
   bootargs.

Prepared and partially verified:

- `tools/run_openocd_jtag_linux_ram.sh` now resets PS, loads PL, preloads
  U-Boot, `uImage`, `uramdisk.image.gz`, `devicetree.dtb`, and `uEnv.txt`, then
  interrupts U-Boot and sends a paced `bootm` command.
- The final factory run used SD-matching bootargs:
  `console=ttyPS0,115200n8 root=/dev/ram rw earlyprintk`.
- The diagnostic run with `ignore_loglevel loglevel=8 initcall_debug` reached
  `Starting kernel ...`, the expected devicetree model, SMP bring-up, rootfs
  unpack start, and many initcalls. It stopped at:
  `calling axi_dmac_driver_init+0x0/0x10 @ 1`.
- `tools/probe_openocd_pl_axi.sh` confirms the lower-level failure: after PS7
  init and PL programming, OpenOCD cannot read `0x7c400000` through the DAP.
  The failure is unchanged when using `PL_LOAD_AFTER_PS7_INIT=1` to load PL
  after PS7 init in the same OpenOCD session.
- It did not reach `brd: module loaded`, `Run /init as init process`, USB
  networking, IIO, or HTTP.

## 1. Decide Whether To Format qspi-nvmfs / mtd2

`mtd2` is currently invalid or unformatted as JFFS2. This does not block boot,
IIO, HTTP, SD boot, QSPI `mtd3` firmware update, or JTAG.

Vendor source includes `device_format_jffs2`, which runs the destructive format
path. Use it only if persistent storage is needed for keys, autorun scripts, or
local configuration:

```sh
device_format_jffs2
```

Before doing this:

- Keep the live QSPI backup.
- Confirm no needed data exists in `mtd2`.
- Capture a before/after serial log.

## 2. Keep mtd0 / mtd1 Flashing Gated

Local boot artifacts are generated:

```text
.config/boot-artifacts/boot/fsbl.elf
.config/boot-artifacts/boot/boot-qspi.bin
.config/boot-artifacts/boot/BOOT.BIN
.config/boot-artifacts/boot/boot.frm
```

Still not done:

- Flashing QSPI `mtd0` / `qspi-fsbl-uboot`.
- Flashing QSPI `mtd1` / `qspi-uboot-env`.

Gate this until all of these are true:

- Normal SD boot restore is verified after JTAG work.
- Normal QSPI boot restore is verified after JTAG work, if the bootloader flash
  operation will depend on QSPI-only recovery.
- SD boot still works.
- OpenOCD JTAG still works.
- Vivado Hardware Manager JTAG still works.
- Live QSPI backup checksums are verified.
- A recovery route is written down and rehearsed.

## 3. Optional Productization Work

Useful but lower urgency:

- Add a single `make` or `just` entry point for common build/test commands.
- Add log rotation or timestamped output directories for repeated board
  captures.
- Create a small OpenOCD no-OS application load example.
- Add an SDR example that uses both RX channels and both TX channels to exercise
  the 2R2T path explicitly.
