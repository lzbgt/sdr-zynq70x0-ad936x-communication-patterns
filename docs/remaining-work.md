# Remaining Work

This page tracks concrete work still open after the verified WSL Arch Yocto,
Vivado, SD boot, QSPI `mtd3`, and OpenOCD JTAG bring-up. Recently closed gates
are kept briefly when they affect the remaining recovery decisions.

## Closed Gate: Normal Boot Restore After JTAG

Status: verified for normal SD boot.

After JTAG/OpenOCD PL programming, the board was returned to normal boot mode
with the SD card still inserted. On this hardware, inserted SD media takes
precedence over QSPI unless the boot control is set to JTAG. Verification passed:

```sh
./tools/verify_board.sh
```

Result: ping, IIO, and HTTP checks passed at `192.168.2.1`.

Optional follow-up: remove the SD card and repeat the same check if a fresh
post-JTAG QSPI-only restore proof is needed.

## Closed Gate: Vivado Hardware Manager On Onboard FT2232H

Status: verified.

The onboard FT2232H now works with Vivado Hardware Manager under WSL Arch after:

- raw FT2232 EEPROM backup,
- Vivado `program_ftdi -write -ftdi FT2232H ...`,
- physical DEBUG/JTAG USB replug and `usbipd` reattach,
- setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/Xilinx/2025.1/Vivado/lib/lnx64.o`.

Verified helpers:

```sh
./tools/probe_vivado_hw_manager.sh
./tools/load_vivado_bitstream.sh
```

## 1. Build A PS-Side JTAG Boot Flow

Verified so far:

- OpenOCD scans the Zynq PL and CPU TAPs.
- OpenOCD loads `system_top.bit` into PL.
- Vivado Hardware Manager detects `arm_dap_0` and `xc7z020_1`.
- Vivado Hardware Manager loads `system_top.bit` into PL.

Not yet verified:

- Loading and running `fsbl.elf` over JTAG.
- Loading U-Boot or a standalone ELF over JTAG.
- Booting Linux from RAM through JTAG.

Candidate implementation:

1. Use `tools/probe_openocd_jtag.sh` as the connection base.
2. Use `.config/boot-artifacts/boot/fsbl.elf`.
3. Add an OpenOCD script that halts `zynq.cpu0`, loads `fsbl.elf`, resumes, and
   captures UART output.
4. Only after FSBL-over-JTAG works, add U-Boot or no-OS application loading.

## 2. Decide Whether To Format qspi-nvmfs / mtd2

`mtd2` is currently invalid or unformatted as JFFS2. This does not block boot,
IIO, HTTP, SD boot, QSPI `mtd3` firmware update, or JTAG.

Vendor source includes `device_format_jffs2`, which runs the destructive format
path. Use it only if persistent storage is needed for keys, autorun scripts, or
local configuration:

```sh
device_format_jffs2
```

Before doing this:

- Keep the live QSPI backup.
- Confirm no needed data exists in `mtd2`.
- Capture a before/after serial log.

## 3. Keep mtd0 / mtd1 Flashing Gated

Local boot artifacts are generated:

```text
.config/boot-artifacts/boot/fsbl.elf
.config/boot-artifacts/boot/boot-qspi.bin
.config/boot-artifacts/boot/BOOT.BIN
.config/boot-artifacts/boot/boot.frm
```

Still not done:

- Flashing QSPI `mtd0` / `qspi-fsbl-uboot`.
- Flashing QSPI `mtd1` / `qspi-uboot-env`.

Gate this until all of these are true:

- Normal SD boot restore is verified after JTAG work.
- Normal QSPI boot restore is verified after JTAG work, if the bootloader flash
  operation will depend on QSPI-only recovery.
- SD boot still works.
- OpenOCD JTAG still works.
- Vivado Hardware Manager JTAG still works.
- Live QSPI backup checksums are verified.
- A recovery route is written down and rehearsed.

## 4. Optional Productization Work

Useful but lower urgency:

- Add a single `make` or `just` entry point for common build/test commands.
- Add log rotation or timestamped output directories for repeated board
  captures.
- Create a small OpenOCD no-OS application load example.
- Add an SDR example that uses both RX channels and both TX channels to exercise
  the 2R2T path explicitly.
